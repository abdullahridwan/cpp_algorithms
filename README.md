# cpp_algorithms
creating/running algorithms in c++. Also combining techniques learned in systems programming class to make code faster!



Current Steps
1. Create graph
2. Run ford fulkerson on graph 
3. After running FF, see if there is full assignment
  - check full assignment if all x in X have a flow 
  OR
  - if flow into t is equal to flow into t == flow out of s
 4. if fa
        then return messages
    else
        message = "no"
        +
        which y's st y+1 in Y allows for fa
